### Changes to API

### Front end
Our API has dramatically changed because we underestimated the communication between the front end and back end. For example, we created TurtleView interface as one of our external APIs. Whenever there is a change in the turtle model, model will call one the methods in this interface to update the view of the turtle in front end. 


### Back end
### Discussion




if those changes are major or minor (justify your distinction based on how much they affected your team mate's code)
if those changes are for better or worse (if for the worse, is there a way to improve it or was the original API overly optimistic)
if your foresee any significant changes coming in the next few days as you finish the project (based on your experience and the fact that you now know all the features to be implemented)
